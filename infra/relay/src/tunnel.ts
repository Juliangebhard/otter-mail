/**
 * The web app's TCP tunnel to mail servers (`GET /v1/tunnel`, protocol in
 * packages/contracts/src/relay.ts). A browser can't open TCP connections, so
 * the relay pipes WebSocket frames to a socket and back. The client does TLS
 * inside the tunnel: the relay only sees ciphertext (and, for STARTTLS, the
 * greeting before the upgrade).
 *
 * It runs in the plain Worker, not a Durable Object: an IDLE connection sits
 * open for hours, and a Worker bills CPU time where a Durable Object bills
 * wall-clock time. Nothing looks at the bytes; one log line per tunnel.
 *
 * Who may open one, to where and how often is worker.ts's business. Here,
 * each tunnel carries at most `maxBytes` each way. The client's bytes are
 * written to the socket a frame at a time, and a client more than
 * BACKLOG_BYTES ahead of the server is cut off. The other way, a Worker's
 * WebSocket has no `bufferedAmount` to show a slow reader, so the server's
 * bytes are read no faster than DOWN_RATE (after a DOWN_BURST): what waits
 * for the client grows no faster than that, and `maxBytes` ends it.
